# Introduction

A project attempting to implement a machine learning algorithm that deploys a multi-layer perceptron to recognize handwritten digits represented by images with a 28x28 image resolution. The model will be trained on a MNIST database of handwritten digit images collected by the US postal office. The training method will heavily rely on a backpropagation algorithm.
